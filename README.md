# Python QR Code Generator

A simple and efficient tool to generate custom QR codes using Python. I built this to easily share my GitHub profile with a quick scan!

##  My Generated QR Code
Scan this to visit my GitHub profile:

![My GitHub QR](./qrtry2.png)

##  How it Works
This project uses the `qrcode` library to handle the data encoding and the `Pillow` library to render the actual image.

### Requirements
You will need to install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install qrcode[pil]
